  <H2>Here's a paragraph about me-</H2>
  <p>
    I am a passionate and dedicated B.Tech CSE student at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, driven by a deep interest in web development, cybersecurity, and creative digital expression. Over time, I have developed solid skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, and I enjoy applying them through hands-on projects such as personal portfolios, landing pages, and calculators. I’ve also explored backend development using Node.js and MongoDB, and am steadily working toward mastering full-stack development with the MERN stack. In parallel, I have a growing enthusiasm for cybersecurity, particularly ethical hacking and bug bounty programs, which I aim to pursue as a long-term career path. Outside of code, I’m a music enthusiast and beat producer, creating lofi and drill-style beats using free and royalty-free samples. My creative mindset complements my technical journey, allowing me to approach problems with both logic and innovation. I constantly seek new opportunities to learn, collaborate, and grow — whether through internships, self-driven projects, or contributions to open-source communities. I take pride in crafting clean, functional, and aesthetically pleasing solutions, and I’m always looking for ways to enhance both my technical and soft skills. I believe in staying curious, staying humble, and always building something meaningful.
